The intake stage of the ticket lifecycle is the process of actually recieving the issues from the end-user. This could be via phone, chat, email, web form submission, or someone bringing an issue to you in person. All of these (including the in-person scenarios) need to be documented for accountability and metric purposes. Whether an end-user is creating the ticket or you are making one for someone else, you will typically be required to enter certain details such as the email address, full name, phone number, the help topic, and a general summary of what the actual issue is that the user is experiencing. These result in the tickets you see when logged into osTicket.

The Assignment and Communication stage of the ticket lifecycle involves ensuring the ticket is assigned to the proper team or group. Observe the details of the ticket such as the Issue Summary, Priority, Department, SLA, and Assigned To sections. These will help you to determine if the ticket has been assigned to the right department and help desk user. If the issue is something critical that cannot be solved by your department or requires permissions and access you do not possess, be sure to reassign it to the correct department and make the proper notations with any changes you make. This includes changes to the department, severity level, and priority.

<p>
The next lifecycle stage is Working the Issue. This part of the process is actually analyzing the issue to figure out a possible solution in order to help the end user fix their problem(s). You can do this by troubleshooting common steps such as reboots, disabling and re-enabling, ensuring all connections are working, etc. There's a plethora of issues you might encounter while solving a ticket but there are many resources you can use such as supervisors, coworkers and even the web. While working their issue, be sure to keep them updated on the process by updating the ticket comment section or even sending an email just to reassure them that the issue is being worked on.
